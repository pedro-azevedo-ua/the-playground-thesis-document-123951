    abstract = {Mobile applications development is complex. In order to build mobile apps that target all users, developers must put up with all the existing operating systems, software development kits (SDKs), devices various screen resolutions and existing mobile app development technology that is in constant evolution. And if this is not enough, developers must choose the right approach to build their app. Taking those decisions has a huge impact on the eventual cost, time, and success of an application building. In order of importance, it comes right after choosing the functionality of the app itself. If developers fail to match an app demands to the right development approach, it can turn their project into a certain failure. This paper aims to compare between the mobile app development approaches and suggest a decisional framework to choose between them.},

    abstract = {Explore the new Kotlin Multiplatform to build native apps for Android and iOS while sharing business logic between apps Key Features Improve app development speed dramatically by writing the business logic in Kotlin Implement a native user interface and work with platform-specific APIs Leverage Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile's code-sharing capabilities for your projects Book Description Sharing code between platforms can help developers gain a competitive edge, and Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) offers a sensible way to do it. KMM helps mobile teams share code between Android and iOS in a flexible way, leaving room for native development. The book begins by helping you to gain a clear understanding of the Kotlin Multiplatform approach, how it works, and how it is different from cross-platform technologies, such as React Native and Flutter, and code sharing options, such as C++. You'll then see how your team can use this software development kit (SDK) to build native applications more effectively by learning timeless concepts and working through practical examples. As you advance, you'll get to grips with the core concepts, understand why UI sharing fails, and get hands-on with developing a small KMM application. Finally, you'll discover expert tips and best practices, along with production- and adoption-related questions, that will help you take the next step in your project and career. By the end of this Kotlin book, you'll have gained a solid understanding of the capabilities of KMM and be able to share code between Android and iOS flexibly. What you will learn Get acquainted with the multiplatform approach and KMM's competitive edge Understand how Kotlin Multiplatform works under the hood Get up and running with the Kotlin language quickly in the context of Swift Find out how to share code between Android and iOS Explore tips and best practices in KMM to increase app development efficiency Discover adoption tips to integrate KMM into existing or new production apps Who this book is for This book is for native Android and iOS developers who want to build high-quality apps using an efficient development process. Knowledge of the framework and the languages used is necessary, that is, Android with Java or Kotlin and iOS with Objective-C or Swift. For Swift developers, the book assumes no knowledge of Kotlin as this will be covered in the context of Swift.},

@article{Huber2021,
    abstract = {Developing the same mobile app for multiple platforms is a prominent challenge for practitioners in mobile software development. When starting an app project, practitioners are faced with a plethora of development approaches to choose from. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are a novel and promising approach for mobile cross-platform development (MCPD). As mobile devices are limited regarding battery capacity, the energy footprint of a mobile app should be kept as low as possible. Thus, the aim of this study is to analyze the difference in energy consumption of PWAs and other mobile development approaches with a focus on UI rendering and interaction scenarios. For this, we implemented five versions of the same app with different development approaches and examined their energy footprint on two Android devices with four execution scenarios. The results show that the used development approach influences the energy footprint of a mobile app. Native development shows the lowest energy consumption. PWAs, albeit not the lowest energy consuming mobile development approach, are a viable alternative to other MCPD approaches. Moreover, the web-browser engine used to execute the PWA has a significant influence on the energy footprint of the app. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

@article{Gerges2024,
    abstract = {Growing use of the cell phones and tablets over the computer for humans’ daily life has increased the development of mobile apps. Different paradigms have been introduced to develop a mobile app. Up till now, the major paradigms have been introduced are native apps, hybrid apps, web app and the new trend namely progressive web app (PWA). Each methodology has its pros and cons. This paper discusses about native development issues and how web app aimed to solve these problems. The hybrid apps will be discussed as a solution of cross-platform development problem of native apps.  In addition, problems of web apps and the gap between web app and native apps will be introduced. PWA is supposed to bridge the gap between native apps and web apps. The main technologies –service worker- will also be discussed.  },

    abstract = {The developers use the cross-platform mobile development solutions to develop the mobile application once and run it on many platforms. Many of these cross-platform solutions are still under research and development. Also, these solutions are based on different approaches such as Cross-Compilation approach, Virtual Machine approach, and Web-Based approach. There are many survey papers about the cross-platform mobile development solutions but they do not include the most recent approaches, including Component-Based approach, Cloud-Based approach, and Merged approach. The main aim of this paper is helping the researchers to know the most recent approaches and the open research issues. This paper surveys the existing cross-platform mobile development approaches and attempts to provide a global view: it thoroughly introduces a comprehensive categorization to the cross-platform approaches, defines the pros and cons of each approach, explains sample solutions per approach, compares the cross-platform mobile development solutions, and ends with the open research areas.}
