\section{Concept}\label{sec:concept}

\subsection{Basketball Context}\label{subsec:basketball-context}
Portugal is cleary not known for its basketball, the quality is far behind other european countries.
In the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) world ranking\cite{fiba}, Portugal is in the 47 place, and in the middle of the European table in 25th place.
Comparing with our neighbours Spain that is in 7th in the world ranking.
However, in the past years, the portuguese basketball achieve some marks.

First, Portugal had its first player in one of the best women league in the world, ``Ticha'' Penicheiro played during 15 seasons in the WNBA in th USA, winning a title with the Sacramento Monarchs, and some individual awards.
And in 2019, entered the Women’s Basketball Hall of Fame, that has the goal of honouring the most influential players in women basketball.\cite{ticha}

After her, Neemias Queta was drafted to the NBA in 2021, being the first portuguese in the NBA, and in the 2023--24 season won his first title with the Boston Celtics.
Besides not being the most valuable player in his team in the USA, he played an important role with the National team in second appearance in the EuroBasket tournament in 2025.
In this campaign, the portuguese team made a surprise performance, passing through the group phase and then, confronting the German team.
In this game the portuguese team was holding up until the last quarter, where the world champions and the winners of the EuroBasket 2025 took the victory.
After the first victory in the EuroBasket, Neemias mentioned that it was a great moment fot the sport in Portugal and wants the sport to grow more in Portugal.\cite{neemias}
To help with this goal, a survey was made in order to understand how players and basketball enthusiasts use the public basketball courts, the frequency, and the problems.

\subsection{Problem}\label{subsec:problem}

After a some conversations with few basketball players and leaning heavily in a survey responses, basketball players and enthusiasts wish to go more often to public courts.
Besides time constraints, this two scenarios and the following complains are in these players mind:

\paragraph{Key Scenarios}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insufficient players}: people arrive to play but cannot form a team because not enough players are present;
    \item \textbf{Overcrowding}: courts are full, forcing players to wait or leave.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Common annoyances reported}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Poor or unpredictable court conditions;
    \item Courts that are either empty or overcrowded;
    \item Social problems between players, including aggressive or unpleasant behaviour, individualistic style, and mismatched competitiveness (players who do not take the game seriously or whose skill and attitude creates a poor experience).
\end{itemize}

These issues point to a coordination and information problem.
Basketball players lack a platform to discover, schedule and evaluate informal games, and to verify court availability and condition.
As a result, players often waste time visiting courts with unsatisfiable condition, which decreases participation and lower quality of both social and sporting experience.

\subsection{Proposed Solution}\label{subsec:proposed-solution}

The proposed solution is to design and implement a digital platform that addresses the coordination and information gaps in amateur basketball in public courts, by focusing on two primary features:

\begin{description}
    \item [Informal Games] ``Pickup games''\footnote{``Pickup games'' is the name used by basketball players to call a game without a formal organization (not in a league, no referee, no strick rules)} -
    Enable players to create, discover and join informal matches (pickup games), with features that support different play modes and social organization:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Players can create, search for and join games listed on the platform;
        \item The games can be competitive or casual;
        \item Competitive games contribute to a leaderboard/raking table per court;
        \item Game formats include 1v1, 3v3, 4v4, 5v5;
        \item Users can create and mange persistent teams and challenge other teams;
        \item Users can set a team as ``next''\footnote{``next'' is used in the casual pickup games to tell the current teams playing, that wants to play against the winning team.} to a game, to play against the winner.
    \end{itemize}

    \item[Court Availability and condition awareness]
    Provide users with real-time and information about courts so they can decide where and when to play:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Persistent court catalogue with attributes - name, location, full/half court, number of courts, has water fountain, etc;
        \item Users can indicate intent to attend a court at a specific time, so others can have an idea of the availability;
        \item User can mark themselves ``present'' at a court;
        \item Optional automatic geolocation-based check-in to simplify presence signalling;
        \item Live occupancy indicators to show how many users intend to go and how many are currently present;
        \item Court condition reporting by the users, they can submit short status updates to report issues.
        \item Display short weather summary for the court location (optional)
    \end{itemize}
\end{description}


\section{State of the Technology}\label{sec:state-of-the-technology}

This platform has to reach the maximum basketball players for it to work properly, and should work when the players are in the court, or anywhere.
In order to achieve this, the platform should be access from the mobile phones, and Statcounter\footnote{Statcounter is a company that provides a tool for users to get insights of their website's visitors} Global Stats reports the following about the Mobile Operating System Market Share in Portugal in September 2025: 65.65\% is from Android, and 33.94\% is iOS\cite{statcount}.
Despite the fact that more than half of people uses Android, the goal is still reach the maximum players possible, so the platform should be accessible from Android and iOS phones.

In order to develop a mobile application for both platforms, there are different options of approaches that can be selected for the implementation, which are the native, cross-platform, web, hybrid, modeling, cloud-based and merged approaches\cite{Khachouch2020}.

\subsection{Native Apps}\label{subsec:native-apps}

Going Native, means that the app will be developed with to a specific OS, using its programming language.
To build native Android applications, developers typically use Kotlin or Java.
Both language are compiled to Java Bytecode that runs on the Android Runtime (ART).
As for iOS, developers use Swift or Objective-C, mainly the first one, to build native iOS applications.

With native apps, there is no need for third-party frameworks, as the code is compiled directly into the platform's native language.
This results in better performance and faster execution compare to other solutions, which will be discussed later.
In addition to performance, native development offers security benefits, since developers can take advantage of the built-in security features of the operating system.
When it comes to  User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX), each platform provides its own guidelines: Android follows Material Design, while iOS follows Human Interface guidelines.
This consistency makes apps easier to navigate, and there is no issues in the app adaptation to other devices.
Finally, native applications can make full use of device features such as the camera, microphone and GPS, which enhances functionality and integration.\cite{Nagy2022}

When the goal is to deliver an application for both Android and iOS using native development, each feature must be implemented twice, once for each platform and in different programming languages.
As Roby Nagy explains in \textit{Simplifying Application Development with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile}\cite{Nagy2022}, the development cost of this approach can be expressed as:


\[Cost of development (n) = n * FC\]

where \textit{n} represents the number of platforms and \textit{FC} the \textit{feature complexity}, defined as the sum of all sub-features that compose a feature.
The figure~\ref{fig:costNative} , taken from Roby Nagy' book\cite{Nagy2022}, illustrates how the development cost grows for two platforms (blue line) and three platforms (red line) as the number of features increases, assuming no cost reduction from sharing code.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Cost of native development as a function of feature comlpexity \cite{Nagy2022}}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/cost_of_native_dev}
    \label{fig:costNative}
\end{figure}


Beyond this calculation, additional factors complicate native development.
Each platform has distinct characteristics, and a solution that is straightforward to implement on one platform may be unavailable or significantly harder to achieve on another.
This divergence creates extra overhead in aligning features sets across platforms.
So, Nagy introduces the additional component, \textit{Synchronization Cost}, which increases in an exponential way as the number of features and its complexity grows.
The updated formula is expressed as:

\[Cost of development (n) = n * FC + Sync Cost ^ {FC}\]


\subsection{Web Applications}\label{subsec:web-applications}

Any application that is access through \textit{HTTP} requests over a network is called a web based application.
These applications are implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Until Progressive Web App appeared, these applications were browser only, but now, they can be installed in the device, can have offline availability, push notifications and background sync, also able to run on desktop.
Developers normally use Angular or React, and other frameworks are StencilJS or Svelte.
However, PWAs cannot access key platform's features as the Native apps can, and also, has a possible higher energy consumption.\cite{Huber2021}


\subsection{Hybrid Applications}\label{subsec:hybrid-applications}

Another option, also leveraging web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, is taking a hybrid approach.
The app is developed with as web app and developers wrap the app via cross-platform wrappers, frameworks and tools, as a native app.
With this approach, the app as a user experience just as a native app.
Some hybrid app frameworks are Cordova, Phonegap, Titanium, Ionic, being the first the most common.
Using third-party plugins with JavaScript, it is possible to access features form the device, such as the camera and GPS\@.
In the Maher Gerges and Ahmed Elgalb article\cite{Gerges2024}, where they compare different approaches, it is compared the hybrid apps directly with the native apps, and, in CPU and Memory occupancy, the hybrid cost more, being 106\% higher and 73.0\% higher in order.
Also, not all features are available and the performance is worse than native apps.\cite{Gerges2024}


\subsection{Cross-Platform Apps}\label{subsec:cross-platform-apps}

In order to avoid repeating the same code for different platforms, there are Cross-Platforms approaches.
With this method, it is possible to create applications that run on multiple operating systems.
In a first look, using cross-platform methods can be an effective solution to develop applications for a multiple platforms, when time, cost and basic interoperability is the primary concern.
On the other hand, Cross-Platform applications tend to have the worst performance and user experience compared with Native apps, as they are behind the evolution of Android and iOS and cannot take full advantage of each platform's features\cite{Nagy2022}.
In different articles and papers, the categorization of the approach varies, especially, when it comes to the Cross-Platform approach, there are subcategories\cite{ELKASSAS2017163}.
The Web and Hybrid approach is normally inserted in this category, alongside with Interpreted approach and Cross-Compiled approach\cite{ELKASSAS2017163}, which the most popular used frameworks are React Native and Flutter, respectively.

\subsubsection{Interpreted Approach - React Native}

Similar to the web and hybrid approach, uses web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript, however, the user interface is not HTML and not render in the browser.\cite{Huber2021}
The most popular used framework is React Native from 2015, developed by Meta, where developers build applications with React components, and the logic in JavaScript.
This framework uses component-based architecture, following the steps of React for the web, promoting code reusability, modularity and easy debug.\cite{10667693}
The JavaScript code executes on a separate thread and communicates with the native layer through a bridge\cite{Nagy2022}, allowing developers performance-critical parts of the app in native languages\cite{10667693}.
The bridge translates asynchronous, serializable data between the two environments, which enables native rendering of components.
However, this approach introduces overhead, resulting in a process generally slower compared to fully native applications.\cite{Nagy2022}

\subsubsection{Cross-Compiled Approach - Flutter}

In this approach, the app is developed in a common language, and then, it is compiled to the native code that can be executed on a mobile device, with Flutter and Xamarin popular examples.\cite{Huber2021}
Flutter is a framework developed by Google, its architecture can be described in three layers, as noted by Roby Nagy in his book\cite{Nagy2022}.
The Framework layer, where developers write the application code and the UI components, declaratively using the Dart language.
The Engine layer renders Flutter widgets to a canvas called Skia Canvas, which is then passed to the final layer, the native platform.
The platform displays the canvas and sends back user events to the framework.\cite,{Nagy2022}
Compared to React Native, Flutter often achieves better performance by relying on Android's Native Development Kit and iOS's Low-Level Virtual Machine to compile code coming from the engine, Flutter applications deliver higher execution performance.
Nevertheless, certain parts of a Flutter application may still need to be implemented in Java/Kotlin and Obj-C/Swift code.
Communication between these native components and the Dart code is through a channel, reducing scalability\cite{Nagy2022}.

\subsubsection{Cloud-based Approach and Modeling Approach}

A Cloud-based application, has its backend in the cloud, instead of running locally, using the cloud features such as flexibility, virtualization and security.\cite{ELKASSAS2017163}
Companies like Amazon Web Services, offer that service called Backend as a Service (BaaS).\cite{Khachouch2020}

There are two subcategories in this approach, the Model-Based User Interface Development (MB-UID) and the Model-Driven Development (MDD).
Developers use abstract model to describe tasks, data, users and the user interface, which will generate source code.
It can transform to code from different platforms.
Some tools include XMobile, for MB-UID and JavaScript Application Framework for MDD\@.

\subsubsection{Cross-Platform vs Native}

So, on one hand, using cross-platform frameworks can be an effective solution to develop applications for multiple platforms, when time, cost and basic interoperability is the primary concern.
On the other hand, these frameworks tend to be behind the evolution of Android and iOS, and cannot take full advantage of each platform's features.
Roby Nagy therefore refines the development-cost equation as:

\[Cost of Development (n) = FC * (1 + Cost of going Native)\]

In this equation, \textit{n} is the number of platforms and \textit{FC} is the feature complexity.
As for the \texttit{Cost of going Native}, reflect the additional effort required when some parts must be implemented with native code.
Its value depends on the level of interoperability that the cross-platform framework provides with native components, which is not optimal.
When there is a necessity to implement native code, the knowledge gap between the framework and native languages adds to the expense, as well as the synchronization.\cite{Nagy2022}\\

With this, it is possible to visualize the different cost of development, adding the Cross-Platform with roadblocks.
The figure\ref{fig:costNative}, illustrates how the cost of cross-platform development increases relative to both cost of Native and Native with Sync Costs.
A roadblock occurs when a required feature cannot be implemented only with the frameworks and must instead be written in native code, producing a sudden rising in cost.
If no native features are required, cross-platform development can remain less expensive with the previous discussed limitations.
However, as more features demand native implementation, the cumulative cost eventually exceeds that of a fully native approach.\cite{Nagy2022}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{Cost of cross-platform development with potential roadblocks as a function complexity\cite{Nagy2022}}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/cost_of_cross}
    \label{fig:costCross}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Kotlin Multiplatform}\label{subsec:kotlin-multiplatform}

Although cross-platforms the previous frameworks solve the problem of dealing with different platforms, it is still not optimal if the application demands platform specific features, and keeping up with Android and iOS updates.
To go around these conditions, developers can choose Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), also a cross-platform solution.
As Jetbrains mentions in their website, Kotlin Multiplatform is an open-source technology developed by JetBrains, that allow developers to create applications for multiple platforms in an efficient way, by reusing code across them and still having the native approach benefits.[cite:@kmpJetbrain]
Developers can share code without losing the qualities of native programming, have good user experience, good app performance and having full platform capabilities, alongside the benefits of the cross-platform, reducing development time, consistency in behavior in the different platforms.
In this approach, the developer has 3 options, it can share and only write a critical feature in Kotlin, or implement the full logic and only develop the UI natively, and finally, with Compose Multiplatform, also share the UI.\cite{kmp}

Jetpack Compose\cite{jetpack} is a toolkit to develop the User Interface of Android apps.
It is implemented in a declarative way, compatible with Kotlin APIs, enabling developers to intuitively build fast UIs.
It also supports Google's Material Design, an ``open-source design system for building beautiful, usable products''\cite{materialD}.
Since 2021, developers can build shared UIs for Android, iOS, desktop and web, feeling natural on every platform with Compose Multiplatform.\cite{compose-multi}

Thompson Carter, refers in his book\cite{kotlinInDepth} the same benefits of KMP, code reusability, faster development, reduce maintenance (as it is only need to fix bugs in one place), flexibility (share code and still access platform-specific features and APIs) and community support.
However, he mentions some challenges as:
- Maturity, as the KMP is recent and is still evolving, some libraries and tools may not be fully supported;
- The integration with Platform-Specific APIs can be challenging;
- The transition from single-platform development can be a bit difficult, with the introduction of new paradigms;
- And the integration with an existing project can involve significant refactoring.

\subsection{Mobile Backend Development Strategies}\label{sec:backend-strategies}

Mobile Applications follow a distributed architecture that has 2 components, frontend and the backend.
The frontend, also called the client-side is the part of the application that runs locally in the user's device.
This is the User Interface, business logic, presentation logic, that can be developed with Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin Multiplatform, for example.
The backend, also called server-side, is executed outside the device, which the user does not interact with directly.
This component can handle the data, reading, writing, updating, and delete data from the database, authenticate users, and more.

In Sullivan De Caril book, chapter 2 \textit{Introduction to Firebase}\cite{DeCarli2023}, he talks about a traditional example of a simple mobile architecture.
He uses the figure\ref{fig:tradicionalBackend} to represent an iOS app that has the Front-end, the user interface code in Swift (see section\ref{subsec:native-apps}), the backend that can manipulate data coded in Ruby or Node.js, and a cloud service, that distributes the data in the cloud (Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud).
He mentions that the application communicates with a virtual machine that can be coded in Ruby, Node.js or even PHP, that is hosted by a cloud service or, less common now, in a physical server.
This is a traditional backend, which, in a complex application is usually required to have separate developers for each part of the application, including a backend developer to code the logic and APIs, and a DevOps to distribute in the cloud\cite{DeCarli2023}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{An iOS app built with a backend host on a cloud service\cite{DeCarli2023}}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/tradicionalBack}
    \label{fig:tradicionalBackend}
\end{figure}

However, a different strategy for the backend, that is more recurrent for developers that what to focus on the application development, is the use of Backend as a Service (BaaS) or Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS)\cite{inproceedings}.
BaaS is a cloud-based service model that provides backend features and tools needed for the mobile application that are executed in the server, such as user authentication, database, remote updating, and push notifications, as well as cloud storage and hosting\cite{saraf2022}.
Firebase\cite{firebaseGoogle}, is an example of a BaaS, and in the second chapter of Sullivan De Caril' book, he introduces the service and shows the figure\ref{fig:firebaseBack}, that represents the iOS application integrating Firebase.
With this, it is possible to see that the backend is managed by the tool and, as Firebase is from Google, it is also built in Google Cloud, having a simpler architecture.
The app receives data from Firebase using the APIs provided, without needing to write code on the server side or having another provider to host\cite{DeCarli2023}.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \caption{An iOS app built with Firebase’s backend\cite{DeCarli2023}}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/firebaseback}
    \label{fig:firebaseBack}
\end{figure}


BaaS platforms provide services such as user  authentication,  database  storage,  cloud  functions,  and real-time  messaging, that speeds  up  development  cycles and   decreases   the   overhead   involved   in   infrastructure management\cite{Shah_Jagtap_Jain_2025}.

The disadvantage of these platforms include the lack of flexibility and fine-grained control, specially when the developer has complex data, custom analytics or there is proprietary infrastructure.
Besides that, when choosing a platform, the app developer is subject to vendor lock-in, becoming dependent in the platforms tools, APIs and data formats.
With this, developers can also go for a hybrid approach, using features form the BaaS and developing other backend features with a programming language\cite{Shah_Jagtap_Jain_2025}.


\subsubsection{Data management}

In mobile applications data management is an important piece that influences the application performance, user experience and business logic.
The ability to store, retrieve, synchronize and secure data determines the success of the majority applications.
Mobile phones have their limitations depending on the model of the phone and where the user is, such as limit battery capacity, variable network connectivity, constraints in storage and other computational capabilities.
A big part of applications need a stable internet connectivity to provide smooth real-time capabilities\cite{offlineFirst1}.

In order to guarantee that the application is always working and not rely only on server connectivity, there is the Offline-First architecture.
With this approach, the application will remain usable without a reliable network connection, it will present the user with the local data instead of waiting for the first network call to complete or fail, and it will fetch data when the optimal conditions are met.
So, the local data is prioritized and when connectivity is restored, the local data can be synchronized\cite{offlineFirst1}.

A hybrid approach for data management is also recurrent, where the application also relies on cloud storage.

Relational and non-relational databases represent two fundamentally different approaches to data management in mobile application development.
Relational databases, organize data into structured tables with predefined schemas and utilize Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation, providing strong ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) that ensure transactional reliability and data integrity\cite{chiriac2025nosql}.
Non-relational or NoSQL databases employ flexible, schema-less data models that accommodate diverse data types without rigid table structures, offering horizontal scalability and superior performance for unstructured data and high-volume operations~\cite{chiriac2025nosql}.
For mobile applications, some examples of databases include, MySQL\cite{mysql}, PostgreSQL\cite{postgresql} and SQLite\cite{SQLite} as Relational databases.
MongoDB Realm\cite{realm}, MongoDB\cite{mongo}, Redis\cite{redis}, examples for NoSQL, as well as Firebase Realtime Database\cite{firebaseRealtime2025} and Firebase Firestore\cite{firestore2025}, with this two last being a Google Cloud solution.
For local database, usual option are between Room\cite{room}, that is an abstraction layer over SQlite, SQLite, Realm or Core Data, Apple's framework for local persistence or cache on iOS\cite{coreData}.
The selection between these database types depends on specific mobile application requirements such as data structure complexity, offline capabilities, synchronization needs, and scalability projections, with modern applications often employing hybrid approaches that leverage both relational and NoSQL databases for different functional domains\cite{Taipalus2024}.


\subsubsection{Data Synchronization}

With data in local storage and data in an external database, data synchronization is critical in mobile applications that depend on multi-user interaction, collaboration and shared data.
Synchronization ensures that all users and devices have consistent up-to-date information.

Following Zach McCormick and Douglas C.Schmidt paper in data synchronization patters\cite{mccormick}, these patterns can be categorized into data synchronization mechanisms patterns (asynchronous vs synchronous), data storage and availability patterns (partial vs complete), and data transfer patterns (full transfer, timestamp transfer, or delta transfer).

Data synchronization mechanisms patterns address how synchronization operations execute relative to the user interface, with asynchronous synchronization performing data transfers in the background without blocking user interactions, thereby maintaining application responsiveness but requiring careful management of concurrent data modifications, while synchronous synchronization blocks the user interface until data transfer completes, guaranteeing immediate consistency at the cost of reduced responsiveness.

Data storage and availability patterns determine the scope of data maintained on mobile devices, where partial storage retains only a subset of server data based on user needs or device constraints to minimize storage requirements and reduce synchronization overhead, whereas complete storage maintains a full replica of server data on the device, enabling comprehensive offline functionality but demanding greater storage capacity and longer initial synchronization times.

Data transfer patterns define what information moves between client and server during synchronization, including full transfer which transmits entire datasets regardless of changes, timestamp transfer which exchanges only records modified since the last synchronization by comparing modification timestamps, and delta transfer which computes and transmits only the specific changes or differences between client and server versions, minimizing bandwidth consumption but increasing computational complexity.

For a good user experience on unreliable networks, an offline-first hybrid architecture is a good option.
Keeping a local databases for immediate responsiveness, use background workers like Android WorkManager\cite{workmanager} and iOS Background Tasks\cite{iosbackgroundtasks}, for scheduled synchronization, and Backend as a Service platforms (Google Firebase, AWS Amplify) for cross-device consistency.
Such architecture balance responsiveness, bandwidth, and storage while allowing application-level conflict-resolution policies to be enforced.


\subsubsection{Backend as a Service}

\paragraph{Google Firebase}

Firebase is a Backend as a Service developed by Google and built on Google Cloud infrastructure,  that provides various functionalities to help build, deploy and manage mobile a and web applications.
Developers do not need to build APIs, as the platform provides its dedicated Software Development Kit (SDK) to interact with its set of tools.
Here are the following tools that Google's Firebase provide:

\begin{description}
    \item [Cloud Firestore] is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development. It keeps the data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so developers can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.\cite{firestore2025}
    \item[Cloud Functions] for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets developers to automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by background events, HTTPS requests, the Admin SDK, or Cloud Scheduler jobs. JavaScript, TypeScript or Python code is stored on Google Cloud infrastructure and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale own servers.\cite{firebasefunctions}
    \item[Realtime Database] is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our Apple platforms, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.\cite{firebaseRealtime2025}
    \item[Authentication] provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to the app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with custom backend.\cite{firebaseAuthentication}
    \item[Local Emulator Suite] consists of individual service emulators built to accurately mimic the behavior of Firebase services. This means you can connect your app directly to these emulators to perform integration testing or QA without touching production data.\cite{emulatorSuite}
    \item[Data Connect] is a relational database service for mobile and web apps that lets developers build and scale using a fully-managed PostgreSQL database powered by Cloud SQL. It provides secure schema, query and mutation management using GraphQL technology that integrates well with Firebase Authentication. Developers can quickly integrate this product into the mobile and web apps with SDK support in Kotlin Android, iOS, Flutter, and web.\cite{firebaseDataConnect}
    \item[Security Rules] leverage extensible, flexible configuration languages to define what data users can access for Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage. Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules leverage JSON in rule definitions, while Cloud Firestore Security Rules and Firebase Security Rules for Cloud Storage leverage a unique language built to accommodate more complex rules-specific structures. Developers can write simple or complex rules that protect the app's data to the level of granularity that the developer's specific app requires.\cite{firebaseRules}
    \item[App Check] helps protect the app backends from abuse by preventing unauthorized clients from accessing the backend resources. It works with both Google services (including Firebase and Google Cloud services) and custom backends to keep resources safe.\cite{firebaseAppCheck}
    \item[Cloud Messaging] (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets developers reliably send messages. It can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. It can send notification messages to drive user re-engagement and retention. For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer a payload of up to 4096 bytes to a client app.\cite{firebaseMsg}
    \item[Other Tools] Firebase provides a several tools for monitoring the app with Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Performance Monitoring, to engage the user with Google Analytics, Firebase In-App Messaging, Google AdMob, Google Ads and more.\cite{firebaseOverview}

However, Firebase presents specific disadvantages, notably the challenge of cost scaling issues due to its pay-as-you-go model (Blaze Plan) for usage exceeding the free threshold, necessitating potential optimization of database queries\cite{ZewdieAyezabu2022, denys}.

\paragraph{Supabase}

Supabase\cite{supabase} is an open-source alternative to the BaaS platform Firebase, as it is a combination of different open-source tools that are scalable\cite{ZewdieAyezabu2022}.
Supabase has the following tools:

\begin{description}
    \item [Database] is a Postgres database, available for every project. The relational struture is advantageous for performing complex queries, joins and full-text searches\cite{ZewdieAyezabu2022}.
    \item[Authentication] makes it easy to implement authentication and authorization in the app. Supabase provides client SDKs and API endpoints to help create and manage users. Users can use many popular Auth methods, including password, magic link, one-time password (OTP), social login, and single sign-on (SSO).\cite{supabaseAuth}
    \item[Storage] it is an open source S3 Compatible Object Store that makes it simple to upload and serve files of any size, providing a robust framework for file access controls. It can store images, videos, documents, and any other file type. Serve assets with a global CDN to reduce latency from over 285 cities globally. Supabase Storage includes a built-in image optimizer, in order to resize and compress media files on demand\cite{supabaseStorage}.
    \item [Edge Functions] are server-side TypeScript functions, distributed globally at the edge — close to the users. They can be used for listening to webhooks or integrating the Supabase project with third-parties.\cite{supabaseEdge}
    \item[Realtime] Supabase provides a globally distributed Realtime service that can send low-latency messages between clients, good for real-time messaging, database changes, cursor tracking, game events, and custom notifications. Track and synchronize user state across clients, ideal for showing who's online, or active participants. And listen to database changes in real-time.\cite{supabaseRealtime}
\end{description}

Supabase also has subscription plans and pay-as-you-go model when exceeding the threshold defined in the plan.

After getting an idea about what are the problems in the portuguese bass made through what is in the market that could solve the main issues.
For this research, different approach were taken to find results.
Below is shown the approach and the results, and then, the results will be analysed deeper.

\subsubsection{Search}
By searching the browser using the query ``Play basketball in Portugal'', the useful links found for someone who just want to go to a public court and play some casual games, or shoot some balls, where from a website called ``Courts of the World''\cite{fiba-courts}, ``Meetup''\cite{meetup}, a question in Reddit from 2021\cite{reddit}, a blog called ``World Baller''\cite{worldBaller}, and some websites for clubs and schools.
With the query ``Basketball pickup games portugal'', the results were similar, with the AI from the browser telling to look for games in Facebook groups, in Meetup, and suggested 3 courts in Lisbon.

Using Perplexity AI, using this prompt in a deep research ``I am from Lisbon and  I play basketball.
I would like to go play on the weekend in a public court.
Where can I go?
Is there any platform I can find some casual games to join?''\cite{perplexity}, the model provided 4 public courts with a description, for example:

``Campo de Laranjeiras ("The Blue Court") near Laranjeiras Metro features two full courts with fresh surfaces and multiple hoops.
Locals refer to it as the "blue court" due to its bright surface color.
It has a semi-competitive vibe with frequent rotation of players and is open 24/7 with free access.''

Besides that, it provided information about a group in Meetup, and a facebook group.
As for platforms, it indicated an app that does not available in Portugal, called ``Pickup: Connect \& Play Sports'', another called ``Pickup Sports (Adult League)''\cite{pickup-adult}.
Then it also shows ``Courts of the World'', that has an iOS application, and another app called ``Fullcourt: Pickup Basketball''\cite{fullcourt-pp}.

Using ChatGPT, with the same prompt, with the free version and the option of \textit{Web Search} activated, it answered with 8 public courts, with the Meetup group already mention above, as well as the facebook group, and the blog ``World Baller''\cite{chatgpt1}.
With the \textit{Thinking} option it provided some courts with the reference to ``Courts of the World'' website and the reddit question from above.
It also provided the same platforms, and gave some tips\cite{chatgpt2}.

Another query made in the browser to explore ways for players to play casual basketball was ``\textit{reservar campos de basquetebol portugal}'' \footnote{book basketball courts portugal}, where it shows some private places to book, and a platform called ``AirCourts''\cite{aircourts}, that gathers different courts from different sports to help users book them.
In the website of AirCourts it was saying that they will join ``Playtomic''\cite{playtonic}, that is a platform to book courts and find players in padel and tennis.

In another search, ``\textit{Torneios amadores portugal basketball}''\footnote{Amatour tournments portugal basketball}, only one result from the first page would be useful for someone who wants to play casual basketball games, the website ``Jogabasket''\cite{jogabasket}.

Going to the Google's Play Store, and searching for ``Pickup'' apps, several appeared, which Perplexity AI already mentioned, as well as, ``Pickup: Play \& Host Sports''\cite{pickup, pickup-app}, ``GoodRec''\cite{goodrec} (it is not available in Portugal), ``WOOOBA''\cite{woooba} and ``Pick-Roll''\cite{pick-roll}.
