\section{Mobile Application Development Approaches}
This platform has to reach the maximum basketball players for it to work properly, and should work when the players are in the court, or anywhere.
In order to achieve this, the platform should be access from the mobile phones, and Statcounter\footnote{Statcounter is a company that provides a tool for users to get insights of their website's visitors} Global Stats reports the following about the Mobile Operating System Market Share in Portugal in September 2025: 65.65\% is from Android, and 33.94\% is iOS\cite{statcount}.
Despite the fact that more than half of people uses Android, the goal is still reach the maximum players possible, so the platform should be accessible from Android and iOS phones.

In order to develop a mobile application for both platforms, there are different options of approaches that can be selected for the implementation, which are the native, cross-platform, web, hybrid, modeling, cloud-based and merged approaches\cite{Khachouch2020}.

\subsection{Native Apps}\label{subsec:native-apps}

Going Native, means that the app will be developed with to a specific OS, using its programming language.
To build native Android applications, developers typically use Kotlin or Java.
Both language are compiled to Java Bytecode that runs on the Android Runtime (ART).
As for iOS, developers use Swift or Objective-C, mainly the first one, to build native iOS applications.

With native apps, there is no need for third-party frameworks, as the code is compiled directly into the platform's native language.
This results in better performance and faster execution compare to other solutions, which will be discussed later.
In addition to performance, native development offers security benefits, since developers can take advantage of the built-in security features of the operating system.
When it comes to User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX), each platform provides its own guidelines: Android follows Material Design, while iOS follows Human Interface guidelines.
This consistency makes apps easier to navigate, and there is no issues in the app adaptation to other devices.
Finally, native applications can make full use of device features such as the camera, microphone and GPS, which enhances functionality and integration.\cite{Nagy2022}

When the goal is to deliver an application for both Android and iOS using native development, each feature must be implemented twice, once for each platform and in different programming languages.
As Robert Nagy explains in \textit{Simplifying Application Development with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile}\cite{Nagy2022}, the development cost of this approach can be expressed as:


\[Cost of development (n) = n * FC\]

where \textit{n} represents the number of platforms and \textit{FC} the \textit{feature complexity}, defined as the sum of all sub-features that compose a feature.
The Figure \ref{fig:costNative} , taken from Robert Nagy' book\cite{Nagy2022}, illustrates how the development cost grows for two platforms (blue line) and three platforms (red line) as the number of features increases, assuming no cost reduction from sharing code.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{Cost of native development as a function of feature comlpexity \cite{Nagy2022}}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/costofnativedev}
	\label{fig:costNative}
\end{figure}


Beyond this calculation, additional factors complicate native development.
Each platform has distinct characteristics, and a solution that is straightforward to implement on one platform may be unavailable or significantly harder to achieve on another.
This divergence creates extra overhead in aligning features sets across platforms.
So, Nagy introduces the additional component, \textit{Synchronization Cost}, which increases in an exponential way as the number of features and its complexity grows.
The updated formula is expressed as:

\[Cost of development (n) = n * FC + Sync Cost ^ {FC}\]

\subsection{Web Applications}\label{subsec:web-applications}

Any application that is access through \textit{HTTP} requests over a network is called a web based application.
These applications are implemented with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Until Progressive Web App appeared, these applications were browser only, but now, they can be installed in the device, can have offline availability, push notifications and background sync, also able to run on desktop.
Developers normally use Angular or React, and other frameworks are StencilJS or Svelte.
However, PWAs cannot access key platform's features as the Native apps can, and also, has a possible higher energy consumption.\cite{Huber2021}

\subsection{Hybrid Applications}\label{subsec:hybrid-applications}

Another option, also leveraging web technologies such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, is taking a hybrid approach.
The app is developed with as web app and developers wrap the app via cross-platform wrappers, frameworks and tools, as a native app.
With this approach, the app as a user experience just as a native app.
Some hybrid app frameworks are Cordova, Phonegap, Titanium, Ionic, being the first the most common.
Using third-party plugins with JavaScript, it is possible to access features form the device, such as the camera and GPS\@.
In the Maher Gerges and Ahmed Elgalb article\cite{Gerges2024}, where they compare different approaches, it is compared the hybrid apps directly with the native apps, and, in CPU and Memory occupancy, the hybrid cost more, being 106\% higher and 73.0\% higher in order.
Also, not all features are available and the performance is worse than native apps.\cite{Gerges2024}

\subsection{Cross-Platform Apps}\label{subsec:cross-platform-apps}

In order to avoid repeating the same code for different platforms, there are Cross-Platforms approaches.
With this method, it is possible to create applications that run on multiple operating systems.
In a first look, using cross-platform methods can be an effective solution to develop applications for a multiple platforms, when time, cost and basic interoperability is the primary concern.
On the other hand, Cross-Platform applications tend to have the worst performance and user experience compared with Native apps, as they are behind the evolution of Android and iOS and cannot take full advantage of each platform's features\cite{Nagy2022}.
In different articles and papers, the categorization of the approach varies, especially, when it comes to the Cross-Platform approach, there are subcategories\cite{ELKASSAS2017163}.
The Web and Hybrid approach is normally inserted in this category, alongside with Interpreted approach and Cross-Compiled approach\cite{ELKASSAS2017163}, which the most popular used frameworks are React Native and Flutter, respectively.

\subsubsection{Interpreted Approach - React Native}

Similar to the web and hybrid approach, uses web technologies such as CSS and JavaScript, however, the user interface is not HTML and not render in the browser.\cite{Huber2021}
The most popular used framework is React Native from 2015, developed by Meta, where developers build applications with React components, and the logic in JavaScript.
This framework uses component-based architecture, following the steps of React for the web, promoting code reusability, modularity and easy debug.\cite{10667693}
The JavaScript code executes on a separate thread and communicates with the native layer through a bridge\cite{Nagy2022}, allowing developers performance-critical parts of the app in native languages\cite{10667693}.
The bridge translates asynchronous, serializable data between the two environments, which enables native rendering of components.
However, this approach introduces overhead, resulting in a process generally slower compared to fully native applications.\cite{Nagy2022}

\subsubsection{Cross-Compiled Approach - Flutter}

In this approach, the app is developed in a common language, and then, it is compiled to the native code that can be executed on a mobile device, with Flutter and Xamarin popular examples.\cite{Huber2021}
Flutter is a framework developed by Google, its architecture can be described in three layers, as noted by Roby Nagy in his book\cite{Nagy2022}.
The Framework layer, where developers write the application code and the UI components, declaratively using the Dart language.
The Engine layer renders Flutter widgets to a canvas called Skia Canvas, which is then passed to the final layer, the native platform.
The platform displays the canvas and sends back user events to the framework.\cite{Nagy2022}
Compared to React Native, Flutter often achieves better performance by relying on Android's Native Development Kit and iOS's Low-Level Virtual Machine to compile code coming from the engine, Flutter applications deliver higher execution performance.
Nevertheless, certain parts of a Flutter application may still need to be implemented in Java/Kotlin and Obj-C/Swift code.
Communication between these native components and the Dart code is through a channel, reducing scalability\cite{Nagy2022}.

\subsubsection{Cloud-based Approach and Modelling Approach}

A Cloud-based application, has its backend in the cloud, instead of running locally, using the cloud features such as flexibility, virtualization and security.\cite{ELKASSAS2017163}
Companies like Amazon Web Services, offer that service called Backend as a Service (BaaS).\cite{Khachouch2020}

There are two subcategories in this approach, the Model-Based User Interface Development (MB-UID) and the Model-Driven Development (MDD).
Developers use abstract model to describe tasks, data, users and the user interface, which will generate source code.
It can transform to code from different platforms.
Some tools include XMobile, for MB-UID and JavaScript Application Framework for MDD\@.



\subsection{Kotlin Multiplatform}\label{subsec:kotlin-multiplatform}

Although cross-platforms the previous frameworks solve the problem of dealing with different platforms, it is still not optimal if the application demands platform specific features, and keeping up with Android and iOS updates.
To address these conditions, developers can choose Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP), also a cross-platform solution.

As Jetbrains mentions in their official documentation, Kotlin Multiplatform is an open-source technology developed by JetBrains that enables developers to create applications for multiple platforms efficiently by reusing code across them and still having the native approach benefits\cite{kmp}.
Developers can share code without losing the qualities of native programming, have good user experience, good app performance and having full platform capabilities, alongside the benefits of the cross-platform, reducing development time, consistency in behavior in the different platforms\cite{Janakaraj2025}.
In this approach, the developer has 3 options, it can share and only write a critical feature in Kotlin, or implement the full logic and only develop the UI natively, and finally, with Compose Multiplatform, also share the UI\cite{kmp}.

Jetpack Compose\cite{jetpack} is a toolkit to develop the User Interface of Android apps.
It is implemented in a declarative way, compatible with Kotlin APIs, enabling developers to intuitively build fast UIs.
It also supports Google's Material Design, an ``open-source design system for building beautiful, usable products''\cite{materialD}.
Since 2021, developers can build shared UIs for Android, iOS, desktop and web, feeling natural on every platform with Compose Multiplatform.\cite{compose-multi}

Thompson Carter, refers in his book\cite{kotlinInDepth} the same benefits of KMP, code re-usability, faster development, reduce maintenance (as it is only need to fix bugs in one place), flexibility (share code and still access platform-specific features and APIs) and community support.
However, he mentions some challenges as:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maturity, as the KMP is recent and is still evolving, some libraries and tools may not be fully supported;
	\item The integration with Platform-Specific APIs can be challenging;
	\item The transition from single-platform development can be a bit difficult, with the introduction of new paradigms;
	\item And the integration with an existing project can involve significant re-factoring.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Comparative Analysis}\label{subsec:overview}

So, on one hand, using cross-platform frameworks can be an effective solution to develop applications for multiple platforms, when time, cost and basic interoperability is the primary concern.
On the other hand, these frameworks tend to be behind the evolution of Android and iOS, and cannot take full advantage of each platform's features.
Robert Nagy therefore refines the development-cost equation as:

\[Cost of Development (n) = FC * (1 + Cost of going Native)\]

In this equation, \textit{n} is the number of platforms and \textit{FC} is the feature complexity.
As for the \textit{Cost of going Native}, reflect the additional effort required when some parts must be implemented with native code.
Its value depends on the level of interoperability that the cross-platform framework provides with native components, which is not optimal.
When there is a necessity to implement native code, the knowledge gap between the framework and native languages adds to the expense, as well as the synchronization.\cite{Nagy2022}

With this, it is possible to visualize the different cost of development, adding the Cross-Platform with roadblocks.
The Figure ~\ref{fig:costNative}, illustrates how the cost of cross-platform development increases relative to both cost of Native and Native with Sync Costs.
A roadblock occurs when a required feature cannot be implemented only with the frameworks and must instead be written in native code, producing a sudden rising in cost.
If no native features are required, cross-platform development can remain less expensive with the previous discussed limitations.
However, as more features demand native implementation, the cumulative cost eventually exceeds that of a fully native approach.\cite{Nagy2022}

\section{Mobile Backend Development Strategies}\label{subsec:backend-strategies}

\subsection{Backend Fundamentals}
Mobile Applications follow a distributed architecture that has 2 components, frontend and the backend.
The frontend, also called the client-side is the part of the application that runs locally in the user's device.
This is the User Interface, business logic, presentation logic, that can be developed with Compose Multiplatform and Kotlin Multiplatform, for example.
The backend, also called server-side, is executed outside the device, which the user does not interact with directly.
This component can handle the data, reading, writing, updating, and delete data from the database, authenticate users, and more.

De Carli (2023, Chapter 2: ``Introduction to Firebase'') describes a traditional mobile architecture example\cite{DeCarli2023}.
He uses the Figure ~\ref{fig:tradicionalBackend} to represent an iOS app that has the Front-end, the user interface code in Swift (see subsection ~\ref{subsec:native-apps}), the backend that can manipulate data coded in Ruby or Node.js, and a cloud service, that distributes the data in the cloud (Microsoft Azure, AWS, Google Cloud).
He mentions that the application communicates with a virtual machine that can be coded in Ruby, Node.js or even PHP, that is hosted by a cloud service or, less common now, in a physical server.
This is a traditional backend, which, in a complex application is usually required to have separate developers for each part of the application, including a backend developer to code the logic and APIs, and a DevOps to distribute in the cloud\cite{DeCarli2023}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{An iOS app built with a backend host on a cloud service\cite{DeCarli2023}}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/tradicionalBack}
	\label{fig:tradicionalBackend}
\end{figure}

However, a different strategy for the backend, that is more recurrent for developers that what to focus on the application development, is the use of Backend as a Service (BaaS) or Mobile Backend as a Service (MBaaS)\cite{inproceedings}.
BaaS is a cloud-based service model that provides backend features and tools needed for the mobile application that are executed in the server, such as user authentication, database, remote updating, and push notifications, as well as cloud storage and hosting\cite{saraf2022}.
Firebase\cite{firebaseGoogle}, is an example of a BaaS, and in the second chapter of Sullivan De Caril' book, he introduces the service and shows the Figure ~\ref{fig:firebaseBack}, that represents the iOS application integrating Firebase.
With this, it is possible to see that the backend is managed by the tool and, as Firebase is from Google, it is also built in Google Cloud, having a simpler architecture.
The app receives data from Firebase using the APIs provided, without needing to write code on the server side or having another provider to host\cite{DeCarli2023}.


\begin{figure}[h]
	\caption{An iOS app built with Firebase’s backend\cite{DeCarli2023}}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figs/firebaseback}
	\label{fig:firebaseBack}
\end{figure}


BaaS platforms provide services such as user authentication,  database storage,  cloud functions,  and real-time messaging, that speeds up development cycles and decreases the overhead involved in infrastructure management\cite{ShahJagtapJain2025}.

The disadvantage of these platforms include the lack of flexibility and fine-grained control, specially when the developer has complex data, custom analytics or there is proprietary infrastructure.
Besides that, when choosing a platform, the app developer is subject to vendor lock-in, becoming dependent in the platforms tools, APIs and data formats.
With this, developers can also go for a hybrid approach, using features form the BaaS and developing other backend features with a programming language\cite{ShahJagtapJain2025}.

\subsection{Data management strategies}

In mobile applications data management is an important piece that influences the application performance, user experience and business logic.
The ability to store, retrieve, synchronize and secure data determines the success of the majority applications.
Mobile phones have their limitations depending on the model of the phone and where the user is, such as limit battery capacity, variable network connectivity, constraints in storage and other computational capabilities.
A big part of applications need a stable internet connectivity to provide smooth real-time capabilities\cite{offlineFirst1}.

In order to guarantee that the application is always working and not rely only on server connectivity, there is the Offline-First architecture.
With this approach, the application will remain usable without a reliable network connection, it will present the user with the local data instead of waiting for the first network call to complete or fail, and it will fetch data when the optimal conditions are met.
So, the local data is prioritized and when connectivity is restored, the local data can be synchronized\cite{offlineFirst1}.

A hybrid approach for data management is also recurrent, where the application also relies on cloud storage.

Relational and non-relational databases represent two fundamentally different approaches to data management in mobile application development.
Relational databases, organize data into structured tables with predefined schemas and utilize Structured Query Language (SQL) for data manipulation, providing strong ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) that ensure transactional reliability and data integrity\cite{chiriac2025nosql}.
Non-relational or NoSQL databases employ flexible, schema-less data models that accommodate diverse data types without rigid table structures, offering horizontal scalability and superior performance for unstructured data and high-volume operations~\cite{chiriac2025nosql}.
For mobile applications, some examples of databases include, MySQL\cite{mysql}, PostgreSQL\cite{postgresql} and SQLite\cite{SQLite} as Relational databases.
MongoDB Realm\cite{realm}, MongoDB\cite{mongo}, Redis\cite{redis}, examples for NoSQL, as well as Firebase Realtime Database\cite{firebaseRealtime2025} and Firebase Firestore\cite{firestore2025}, with this two last being a Google Cloud solution.
For local database, usual option are between Room\cite{room}, that is an abstraction layer over SQlite, SQLite, Realm or Core Data, Apple's framework for local persistence or cache on iOS\cite{coreData}.
The selection between these database types depends on specific mobile application requirements such as data structure complexity, offline capabilities, synchronization needs, and scalability projections, with modern applications often employing hybrid approaches that leverage both relational and NoSQL databases for different functional domains\cite{Taipalus2024}.

\subsection{Data Synchronization}

With data in local storage and data in an external database, data synchronization is critical in mobile applications that depend on multi-user interaction, collaboration and shared data.
Synchronization ensures that all users and devices have consistent up-to-date information.

Following Zach McCormick and Douglas C.Schmidt paper in data synchronization patters\cite{mccormick}, these patterns can be categorized into data synchronization mechanisms patterns (asynchronous vs synchronous), data storage and availability patterns (partial vs complete), and data transfer patterns (full transfer, timestamp transfer, or delta transfer).

Data synchronization mechanisms patterns address how synchronization operations execute relative to the user interface, with asynchronous synchronization performing data transfers in the background without blocking user interactions, thereby maintaining application responsiveness but requiring careful management of concurrent data modifications, while synchronous synchronization blocks the user interface until data transfer completes, guaranteeing immediate consistency at the cost of reduced responsiveness.

Data storage and availability patterns determine the scope of data maintained on mobile devices, where partial storage retains only a subset of server data based on user needs or device constraints to minimize storage requirements and reduce synchronization overhead, whereas complete storage maintains a full replica of server data on the device, enabling comprehensive offline functionality but demanding greater storage capacity and longer initial synchronization times.

Data transfer patterns define what information moves between client and server during synchronization, including full transfer which transmits entire datasets regardless of changes, timestamp transfer which exchanges only records modified since the last synchronization by comparing modification timestamps, and delta transfer which computes and transmits only the specific changes or differences between client and server versions, minimizing bandwidth consumption but increasing computational complexity.

When data is written locally while offline, there will be differences between the online data, and there will be a conflict that needs to be resolve before synchronization.
There are several conflict resolution strategies, such as Server Wins or Client Wins, where it is decided if the data in the server prevails over the client or the other way, Merge conflict by implementing logic to merge changes when possible with user intervention possible needed with complex data, Vector Clocks when there is a complex scenario, helping understand the relationships between changes\cite{mediuDataSync}. Another method that Androids mentions in its documentation is called Last write wins, where the device adds metadata to the written data in the network, and when the network data source receives, any older data will be discard\cite{LastWriteWin}. This can result in data loss if two offline devices write conflicting updates sequentially; when both reconnect and synchronize, the data written by the first device will be discarded.

For a good user experience on unreliable networks, an offline-first hybrid architecture is a good option.
Keeping a local databases for immediate responsiveness, use background workers like Android WorkManager\cite{workmanager} and iOS Background Tasks\cite{iosbackgroundtasks}, for scheduled synchronization, and Backend as a Service platforms (Google Firebase, AWS Amplify) for cross-device consistency.
Such architecture balance responsiveness, bandwidth, and storage while allowing application-level conflict-resolution policies to be enforced.

\subsection{MBaaS Providers}

There are several different solutions to choose for MBaaS, from big cloud corporations such has Google's Firebase, Amazon's AWS Amplify, Microsoft Azure, to open-source like Supabase, Parse, Back4App. Below are some relevant MBaaS:

\subsubsection{\textbf{Google Firebase}}

Firebase is a Backend as a Service developed by Google and built on Google Cloud infrastructure,  that provides various functionalities to help build, deploy and manage mobile a and web applications.
Developers do not need to build APIs, as the platform provides its dedicated Software Development Kit (SDK) to interact with its set of tools.
Here are the following tools that Google's Firebase provide:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Cloud Firestore} - is a flexible, scalable database for mobile, web, and server development. It keeps the data in sync across client apps through realtime listeners and offers offline support for mobile and web so developers can build responsive apps that work regardless of network latency or Internet connectivity. Cloud Firestore also offers seamless integration with other Firebase and Google Cloud products, including Cloud Functions.\cite{firestore2025}
	\item \textbf{Cloud Functions} - Firebase is a serverless framework that lets developers to automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by background events, HTTPS requests, the Admin SDK, or Cloud Scheduler jobs. JavaScript, TypeScript or Python code is stored on Google Cloud infrastructure and runs in a managed environment. There's no need to manage and scale own servers.\cite{firebasefunctions}
	\item \textbf{Realtime Database} - is a cloud-hosted database. Data is stored as JSON and synchronized in realtime to every connected client. When you build cross-platform apps with our Apple platforms, Android, and JavaScript SDKs, all of your clients share one Realtime Database instance and automatically receive updates with the newest data.\cite{firebaseRealtime2025}
	\item \textbf{Authentication} - provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to the app. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular federated identity providers like Google, Facebook and Twitter, and more. Integrates tightly with other Firebase services, and it leverages industry standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, so it can be easily integrated with custom backend.\cite{firebaseAuthentication}
	\item \textbf{Local Emulator Suite} - consists of individual service emulators built to accurately mimic the behavior of Firebase services. This means you can connect your app directly to these emulators to perform integration testing or QA without touching production data.\cite{emulatorSuite}
	\item \textbf{Data Connect} - is a relational database service for mobile and web apps that lets developers build and scale using a fully-managed PostgreSQL database powered by Cloud SQL. It provides secure schema, query and mutation management using GraphQL technology that integrates well with Firebase Authentication. Developers can quickly integrate this product into the mobile and web apps with SDK support in Kotlin Android, iOS, Flutter, and web.\cite{firebaseDataConnect}
	\item \textbf{Security Rules} - leverage extensible, flexible configuration languages to define what data users can access for Realtime Database, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage. Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules leverage JSON in rule definitions, while Cloud Firestore Security Rules and Firebase Security Rules for Cloud Storage leverage a unique language built to accommodate more complex rules-specific structures. Developers can write simple or complex rules that protect the app's data to the level of granularity that the developer's specific app requires.\cite{firebaseRules}
	\item \textbf{App Check} - helps protect the app backends from abuse by preventing unauthorized clients from accessing the backend resources. It works with both Google services (including Firebase and Google Cloud services) and custom backends to keep resources safe.\cite{firebaseAppCheck}
	\item \textbf{Cloud Messaging} (FCM) is a cross-platform messaging solution that lets developers reliably send messages. It can notify a client app that new email or other data is available to sync. It can send notification messages to drive user re-engagement and retention. For use cases such as instant messaging, a message can transfer a payload of up to 4096 bytes to a client app.\cite{firebaseMsg}
	\item \textbf{Other Tools } - Firebase provides a several tools for monitoring the app with Firebase Crashlytics and Firebase Performance Monitoring, to engage the user with Google Analytics, Firebase In-App Messaging, Google AdMob, Google Ads and more.\cite{firebaseOverview}
\end{itemize}


To use Firebase there are two option in terms of Pricing Plans, the \textit{Spark Plan} which is the free plan, and the \textit{Blaze Plan} that is a pay as you go plan, meaning that, when passing a threshold in a specific feature, there is a cost associated.
Here are the limits\cite{firebasePrice}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Authentication} - there is no cost until 50k Monthly Active Users (MAUs), where with the Blaze Plan you pay more for each MAU where the maximum is 0.0025USD per extra MAU if there are more than 10,000,000.
	\item \textbf{Cloud Firestore} - the free version has 1GiB in Store data, 20k document writes per day, 50k document reads and 20k deletions. In the paid plan, when passin the limit the developer has to pay 0.039USD per 100,000 document reads, 0.117USD per 100,000 document writes, 0.013USD per 100,00 document deletions and 0.117 per GiB of storage per month, also having a backup data with 0.039USD per GiB.
	\item \textbf{Cloud Functions} - there is no cost until 2M invocations per month, and there are some limits for the procession power.
	\item \textbf{Cloud Storage} - it has 5GB in the free plan for storage, 1GB per day in download, 20k upload operations per day and 50K downloads.

	\item \textbf{Realtime database} - the free tier offers 1GB of storage and in the paid it is 5USD per GB extra.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Supabase}}

Supabase\cite{supabase} is an open-source alternative to the BaaS platform Firebase, as it is a combination of different open-source tools that are scalable\cite{ZewdieAyezabu2022}.
Supabase has the following tools:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Database} - a Postgres database, available for every project. The relational struture is advantageous for performing complex queries, joins and full-text searches\cite{ZewdieAyezabu2022}.
	\item \textbf{Authentication} - makes it easy to implement authentication and authorization in the app. Supabase provides client SDKs and API endpoints to help create and manage users. Users can use many popular Auth methods, including password, magic link, one-time password (OTP), social login, and single sign-on (SSO).\cite{supabaseAuth}
	\item \textbf{Storage} - open source S3 Compatible Object Store that makes it simple to upload and serve files of any size, providing a robust framework for file access controls. It can store images, videos, documents, and any other file type. Serve assets with a global CDN to reduce latency from over 285 cities globally. Supabase Storage includes a built-in image optimizer, in order to resize and compress media files on demand\cite{supabaseStorage}.
	\item \textbf{Edge Functions} - server-side TypeScript functions, distributed globally at the edge — close to the users. They can be used for listening to webhooks or integrating the Supabase project with third-parties.\cite{supabaseEdge}
	\item \textbf{Realtime} - Supabase provides a globally distributed Realtime service that can send low-latency messages between clients, good for real-time messaging, database changes, cursor tracking, game events, and custom notifications. Track and synchronize user state across clients, ideal for showing who's online, or active participants. And listen to database changes in real-time.\cite{supabaseRealtime}
\end{itemize}

For features not natively provided by Supabase, such as push notifications or built-in analytics, developers can integrate third-party services, webhooks, or direct API integrations\cite{supabaseIntegrations}.

Supabase has 2 main plans, the free option and a pro option where the developer pays 25USD per month\cite{supabasePricing}.
Here what a developer gets with each plan:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Database} - The free plan gets 500MB os database size, and the pro gets 8GB with option of paying more 0.125USD per extra GB. With the pro plan, the developer gets automatic backups of seven days, the project is never paused, has point of recovery for 100USD per month per 7 days retention, and more.
	\item \textbf{Authentication} - There are unlimited users, but in the free plan there is the limit of 50,000 Monthly Active Users (MAUs) and 100,000 MAUs for the pro plan, with the option of paying 0.00325USD per MAU extra. The pro plan has extra featuers.
	\item \textbf{Storage} - The free plan has 1GB include of storage while the paid has 100GB then 0.021USD per GB. The free plan has the max file upload size of 50MB and the paid has 500GB.
	\item \textbf{Realtime} - It has the current peak connection where in the free plan has 200 included and the pro plan has 500 with 10USD per 1000 more. The free has 2 Million messages per month included while the pro has 5 Million paing 2.50USD per Million extra.
	\item \textbf{Edge Functions} - The free plan has 500,000 invocations included while the pro plan as 2 Million with 2USD per Million extra.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{\textbf{Parse}}

Parse is an open-source Mobile Backend as a Service, that provides tools to develop the backend of mobile applications.
This option was from Facebook that decided to shut down and make it open-source and now, developers have to host the service, either in platforms that can manage Parse Server or self-host in a cloud service or in private servers\cite{ParseBack4App}.
Parse Platform has similar features has the other services, which are\cite{ParseFeatures}:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Database \& Storage} - Supports MongoDB and PostgreSQL for structured data, with flexible file storage options including Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local filesystem storage. GridFS is commonly used as the default large-file storage when MongoDB is chosen\cite{Gridfs}. Parse also supports multi-database deployments and can be configured to shard or separate concerns across databases for scale and isolation.
	\item \textbf{Real-time} - Live queries for real-time data updates and built-in push notification support across all platforms, with real time updates.
	\item \textbf{Authentication \& Security} - Provides comprehensive user management (signup, login, password reset) with support for OAuth, email verification, and custom authentication.
	\item \textbf{APIs \& Integration} - REST and GraphQL APIs with multi-platform SDKs for seamless integration across all major platforms. Supports custom queries and mutations.
	\item \textbf{Cloud Functions} - Allows server-side logic via custom Cloud Functions, database triggers that run on create/update/delete events, and background job processing for async or scheduled tasks.
	\item \textbf{Self-hosting Freedom} - Can be deployed anywhere that runs Node.js (cloud VMs, containers). Full control over infrastructure and data, with a Parse Dashboard for visual management and monitoring, guaranteing complete data ownership.
\end{itemize}

Parse platform and server are free and open-source, however, the cost lays in the hosting.

\subsubsection{\textbf{Back4App}}

Back4App is another MBaaS, cloud-hosted solution, that runs and hardened the open-source Parse Platform, exposing the same APIs and SDKs while adding management, scalability, backups and developer tools\cite{Back4AppParse}.
With this platform, developers can take advantage of Parse functionalities while simplifying deployment and infrastructure management.
In terms of features, they are and work the same as the Parse, adding hosting, managing and UI features\cite{Back4App}.
With Back4App there is no vendor lock-in, meaning that the developer can, anytime, export the database, files, Cloud code and run the same Parse Server elsewhere\cite{Back4AppAlternatives}.


In terms of pricing, the platform has a free plan, the MVP to ``Validate Ideas Quickly — Launch Fast on Our Managed Serverless Backend'' (15USD per month paying annually or 25USD monthly), Pay as you go to ``Run \& Scale Applications on a Serverless Infrastructure'' (80USD or 100USD per month) and the Dedicated to ``Production-Grade Speed, Isolation \& Flexibility on Dedicated Resources''(400USD or 500USD per month)\cite{Back4AppPrice}.
Here are the differences:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Request per month} - in the free plan is 25k requests, while the MVP is raised to 500k with 5USD per 100k extra request, the Pay as you go 5M with 2USD per 100k extra, and the last one is unlimited.
	\item \textbf{Data Storage }- the free plan has 250MB then is 1GB followed by 3GB and then 8GB, with 15USD monthly for each adicional gigabyte extra.
	\item \textbf{Data Transfer} - the free plan allows 1GB, the MVP is 250GB, the Pay as you go is 1TB and the Dedicated is 2TB, with 0.1USD per each 1GB of adicional transfer.
	\item \textbf{File Storage} - the free plan has 1GB, then 50GB, 250GB and 1TB, with 1USD charge per 10GB extra.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{MBaaS Provider Comparison}

Table~\ref{tab:mbaas_features} presents a comprehensive comparison of the major MBaaS providers currently available in the market. The feature matrix demonstrates that modern MBaaS platforms have converged on a common set of core functionalities, including authentication mechanisms, real-time data synchronization capabilities, serverless computing through Cloud Functions, and comprehensive security rules. All evaluated providers offer APIs (both REST and GraphQL), file storage services, and offline support, reflecting the maturation and standardization of the MBaaS ecosystem.

However, significant differences emerge in the areas of database technology choices, open-source availability, and infrastructure control. Notably, Supabase distinguishes itself by offering only relational database technology (PostgreSQL), whereas other providers support both NoSQL and SQL databases, providing developers with flexibility in selecting the most appropriate data model for their application. Additionally, the degree of vendor lock-in varies considerably, with open-source solutions like Supabase and Parse offering greater portability and self-hosting capabilities, while proprietary platforms such as Firebase and AWS Amplify provide tightly integrated ecosystems with limited exit strategies.

\section{Related Work}

To understand the existing solutions available in the Portuguese casual basketball market, it was conducted a search for applications and platforms addressing the challenges identified.
This section presents the research methodology and the identified applications.


\subsection{Methodology}
By searching the browser using the query ``Play basketball in Portugal'', the useful links found for someone who just want to go to a public court and play some casual games, or shoot some balls, where from a website called ``Courts of the World''\cite{fiba-courts}, ``Meetup''\cite{meetup}, a question in Reddit from 2021\cite{reddit}, a blog called ``World Baller''\cite{worldBaller}, and some websites for clubs and schools.
With the query ``Basketball pickup games Portugal'', the results were similar, with the AI from the browser telling to look for games in Facebook groups, in Meetup, and suggested 3 courts in Lisbon.

Using Perplexity AI, using this prompt in a deep research ``I am from Lisbon and I play basketball.
I would like to go play on the weekend in a public court.
Where can I go?
Is there any platform I can find some casual games to join?''\cite{perplexity}, the model provided 4 public courts with a description, for example:

``Campo de Laranjeiras ("The Blue Court") near Laranjeiras Metro features two full courts with fresh surfaces and multiple hoops.
Locals refer to it as the "blue court" due to its bright surface colour.
It has a semi-competitive vibe with frequent rotation of players and is open 24/7 with free access.''

Besides that, it provided information about a group in Meetup, and a facebook group.
As for platforms, it indicated an app that does not available in Portugal, called ``Pickup: Connect \& Play Sports'', another called ``Pickup Sports (Adult League)''\cite{pickup-adult}.
Then it also shows ``Courts of the World'', that has an iOS application, and another app called ``Fullcourt: Pickup Basketball''\cite{fullcourt-pp}.

Using ChatGPT, with the same prompt, with the free version and the option of \textit{Web Search} activated, it answered with 8 public courts, with the Meetup group already mention above, as well as the facebook group, and the blog ``World Baller''\cite{chatgpt1}.
With the \textit{Thinking} option it provided some courts with the reference to ``Courts of the World'' website and the reddit question from above.
It also provided the same platforms, and gave some tips\cite{chatgpt2}.

Another query made in the browser to explore ways for players to play casual basketball was ``\textit{reservar campos de basquetebol portugal}'' \footnote{book basketball courts portugal}, where it shows some private places to book, and a platform called ``AirCourts''\cite{aircourts}, that gathers different courts from different sports to help users book them.
In the website of AirCourts it was saying that they will join ``Playtomic''\cite{playtonic}, that is a platform to book courts and find players in padel and tennis.

In another search, ``\textit{Torneios amadores portugal basketball}''\footnote{Amateur tournaments Portugal basketball}, only one result from the first page would be useful for someone who wants to play casual basketball games, the website ``Jogabasket''\cite{jogabasket}.

Going to the Google's Play Store, and searching for ``Pickup'' apps, several appeared, which Perplexity AI already mentioned, as well as, ``Pickup: Play \& Host Sports''\cite{pickup, pickup-app}, ``GoodRec''\cite{goodrec} (it is not available in Portugal), ``WOOOBA''\cite{woooba} and ``Pick-Roll''\cite{pick-roll}.

\subsection{Existing Projects}

It was found three categories of existing platforms relevant to casual basketball in Portugal: dedicated court discovery platforms, game organization platforms, general community platforms.

\subsubsection{Court Discovery Platforms}

\paragraph{\textbf{Courts of the World}}\cite{fiba-courts}

Is a FIBA endorsed platform, available in web and in iOS, where users can find courts around the world.
In the home page, the users can search for a place or click a button to view basketball courts near the user, which did not work when searching for Lisbon or Porto and even clicking in the button, it was loading for a long time.
There is a section called ``The World’s Favorite Basketball Courts'' that shows cards with famous courts.
In the menu is the option to list the courts, that has list of countries divided by continent.
Going to Portugal, it appears the most popular courts.
Opening the first court in the most popular, ``Campo Dos Mártires Da Pátria'', there user can view on the map (which does not work), rate the court, this one having 8 ratings, an option to check in, saying the player is there, and the platform asks for the location to confirm, and it is saying that 1 player checked in last 5 years ago, and the user can save the court, with 7 players saving.
Besides that, there are some photos of the court, with the last uploaded November 2024 (at the date), and any player can upload media.
Players can add information about the court and see local insights, such has the weather conditions.
In the platform, there is also a blog and a section of the players, with a leaderboard of players that contribute for the platform, with courts added, photos and comments.
This looks like a good option for players to find courts, and it looks like it has a feature of check in, so other players can see how full is the court.
However, it looks like there is not much adherence on the part of the players.

\paragraph{\textbf{Jogabasket}}\cite{jogabasket} 

From the part of the Portuguese Basketball Federation, this website has the same purpose as the Courts of the World.
In the home page, the user can find clubs, by searching a location, showing clubs as the result and their contacts.
Scrolling down, the user can find some courts around Portugal, with map that works perfectly.
There is also a section to find 3x3 tournaments, but, at the time of writing, there is nothing there.
Finally, there are some images of the courts.
This website is good for users to find courts in Portugal.
